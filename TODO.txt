This is a list of things I wanted to do if I had more time:

Refactoring:
- Move all validation logic to a separate class.

Testing:
Add tests for these scenarios:
    
    - Low priority, created date more than an hour ago and, has no flag, priority should be moved to medium

    - Medium priority, created date more than an hour ago and, has no flag, priority should be moved to High and an email sent
    
    - Low priority, created date less than an hour ago, but contains a flag, should raise priority to Medium
    
    - validation empty strings, and nulls should throw exceptions
    
    - check for hitting emails when ticket moves to High priority
    
    - check non paying customers don't have accountManager, and vice versa
    
    - Test AssignTicket by creaing a ticket, then changing the assignedUser. Updated ticket should have the new account manager
    
    - Different price scenarios
